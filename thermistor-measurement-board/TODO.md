TODO
=====

Stuff to add:

* Load switch for current sources, maybe

* Assembly notes for connector pinouts

Stuff to check:

* whether there's an easy way to run one channel from a current source and the other from one of the voltage references

* check whether there are other lines that need (or might want) pull resistors

* review all signals, make sure they are being driven properly, DNP annotations make sense, etc

* check all resistor values for noise susceptibility (especially dividers and pull resistors used or overridden to enter shutdown modes)

* error propagation of voltage and current references

* error propagation of sensor signals

* check whether there are any additional test points needed (especially for calibration)
