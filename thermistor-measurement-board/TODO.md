TODO
=====

Stuff to add:

* Load switch for current sources

Stuff to check:

* check whether there are other lines that need (or might want) pull resistors

* make sure all ICs' pull resistors default to OFF

* active-mode current consumption of all ICs

* shutdown-mode current consumption of all ICs

* current consumption and noise susceptibility of all dividers and pull-up/down resistors (especially pull resistors used or overridden to enter shutdown modes)

* error propagation of voltage and current references

* error propagation of sensor signals

* check whether there are any additional test points needed (especially for calibration)
