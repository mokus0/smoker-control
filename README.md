Smoker Command Center
======================

First, an up front warning:  I don't have nearly enough time for this project.  Feel free to use anything you want from this project, and if you run into issues I'd love to try to help - *if* I can find the time.  And that's a BIG "if".

Now that that's out of the way... This is the very beginning of a project that brings together two of my favorite hobbies, neither of which I do nearly enough of: electronics and cooking.  There's not much to see here yet, and there may never be, but what I'd *like* to make here is a weatherproof, wireless, battery powered (with solar charging) general-purpose sensor pod, rigged up with a bunch of useful sensors on my backyard smoker.

On the software side, I'd like to put together a sort of "big board", giving me a nice overview of the recent history of the sensors and some analysis of the data (rates of change of temperatures, estimated amount of fuel to add, estimated time to reach target temperatures, etc.).

For now, I've got a sensor measurement board design I'm working on.  It's primarily designed for precision resistance measurements across 5 decades, but useful for a lot of other analog sensors.
